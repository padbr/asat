Amplicon Sequence Analysis Tools
https://github.com/padbr/asat

INTRODUCTION
------------
The purpose of this repository is primarily to document custom scripts that I
use during analysis of amplicon sequencing datasets, when preparing peer
reviewed manuscripts for publication. My datasets will probably primarily be
microbial community analyses, using primers targeting hypervariable regions of
the 16S rRNA gene for prokaryotic community analyses and ITS for fungal
community analyses, sequenced using Illumina's MiSeq or iSeq platforms.

This repository isn't intended to develop nor present a complete pipeline for
performing amplicon data analysis. It is just to document the use of custom
scripts within such pipelines as necessasry for citation in peer-reviewed
publications. That said, if you find any script presented here useful, you are
of course free to use it according to the terms of the GNU General Public
License v3 (see https://github.com/padbr/asat/LICENSE).


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Operating system: Linux
    I typically use a 64-bit linux machine. In theory python scripts can work in
    other operating systems such as Windows or OSX. However, I have taken no
    precautions to ensure that my code does run on such platforms.

Hardware: very modest hardware should suffice
    This will depend a lot on the size of the datasets being analyzed and
    whether or not I have written a given script in such a way as to avoid
    loading all sequencing reads into memory at once. Typically, I do not go to
    the trouble of parallelizing my scripts.
    Probably, a machine with 8 GB of RAM and enough free disk space to handle
    the sometimes large high-throughput sequencing datasets should suffice.

Software:
    Python 2.7.x
    I write primarily in python, using version 2.7.x. I haven't made my code
    compatible with python3. If I do update to make it compatible, I will do so
    with backwards compatibility to python2.7 as a high priority. The libraries
    required for my scripts will vary from script to script, but I regularly use
    biopython, matplotlib, numpy and scipy. These libraries can easily be
    installed with pip.

INSTALL
-------
No particular installation is required, but it is much more convenient if the
stand-alone python scripts are placed somewhere referenced by the PATH
environment variable.

OVERVIEW OF SCRIPTS (usage instructions are detailed within each script)
-------------------
strip_degen_primer.py
    Typically, amplicon sequencing datasets contain the primer sequences at the
    starts of the R1 and R2 reads. As these sequences are artifactual it is
    desirable to remove them. That is the purpose of this script. It takes as
    mandatory arguments, (degenerate) primer sequences and R1 and R2 read files
    (it only works on paired reads only). It assumes that the reads are
    directional (i.e. that R1 should have the forward primer and R2 should have
    the reverse primer). It allows for mismatches to the degenerate primers.
    If no discernable primer sequence is found in either or both of the R1 and
    R2 reads, the read pair will be discarded. The output files will contain the
    paired reads, in separate R1 and R2 files. The matched primer sequences will
    be stripped from the reads in the output files, while the read names will be
    kept as they were.
    I would like to point out that some people advocate keeping at least a part
    of the primer sequences. The reasoning is that it helps to anchor the ends
    of an alignment which would be used to make a tree for Î²-analysis. I would
    argue that primers are artifactual and should be removed as mismatched
    amplification is definitely possible. However, especially given that PCR is
    much more sensitive to mismatches near the 3' end of the primers, I think
    that it is okay to make the compromise advocated by many and keep the last
    five nucleotides of the primers (especially if they are not degenerate
    positions) in order to anchor an alignment. This is not supported in this
    script, but I just feel like mentioning this point for balance and to allow
    the reader to best consider if this script is suitable for their needs.
